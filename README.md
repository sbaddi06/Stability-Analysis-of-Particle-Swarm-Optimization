# Stability-Analysis-of-Particle-Swarm-Optimization
To develop stability criteria and hence evaluate the rate of convergence of particle swarm optimization.
# Objectives
The following are the key objectives on which we focused:
- Numerical Optimization Techniques.
- Particle Swarm Optimization. 
- Stability Analysis of Linear and Non-Linear systems.
- Propose a new methodology to determine stability of Optimization Technique.
- Evaluate Stability and rate of convergence of PSO.
# Methodology
![image] 
- The input might be any objective function that has to be optimised. 
- The Particle Swarm Algorithm is used to optimise the objective function. 
- When we receive an output from PSO, we examine it for stability using three or four stability criteria, which include exploration, exploitation, rate of convergence,     and stopping criteria.
- We consider the algorithm to be stable if all of the stability conditions have been satisfied. 
- Otherwise, we tune the parameters of PSO using concepts such as constriction co-efficient, velocity clamping, inertia weight, and acceleration co-efficients.
